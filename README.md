# Snake-Game-GUI
Snakeis avideo gamethat originated during the late 1970s inarcadesbecoming something of a classic. It became the standard pre-loaded game onNokiaphones in 1998.The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling asnake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows.
